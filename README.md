Welcome to the Roadmaps Repository!

If you want to create a new career path, here's the process you need to follow:

1. Talk with your manager - It's important to inform your manager about your initiative to create a career path. 
They will provide you with any necessary information and guidance on how to proceed.

2. Inform one of the existing owners of the organization - After you have discussed your ideas with your manager, 
you should inform one of the existing owners of the organization about your plans.

3. Invitation to the organization - The owner will then invite you to the organization so that you can start creating the creer path.

4. Start working on the roadmap - Once you are a member of the organization, you can start working on the roadmap.
You will have access to all the necessary resources and tools to create a comprehensive and effective roadmap.

We hope that this process will help you in creating a valuable roadmap that will contribute to the growth and development of the organization.

Best regards,
The Roadmaps Repository Team.
